### 1. What `Navigator.push` returns

When you do:

```dart
final result = await Navigator.of(context).push(...);
```

* `Navigator.push` **returns a `Future`**.
* That `Future` only **completes when the pushed route is popped** (i.e., when `Navigator.pop` is called from inside the pushed screen).
* The value you pass to `Navigator.pop(context, value)` will become the `result` of that `Future`.

---

### 2. Why `await` makes the difference

If you just do:

```dart
Navigator.push(...);
refreshNotes(); // runs immediately
```

* `refreshNotes` runs **right after pushing**, before the user even sees the `CreateNote` screen.

But with `await`:

```dart
await Navigator.push(...);
refreshNotes(); // runs only after pop
```

* The `await` pauses execution until the Future from `push` is completed → i.e., until the pushed screen calls `Navigator.pop`.
* This guarantees that `refreshNotes` won’t run until the user has finished with the `CreateNote` screen and returned.

### 3. Visual timeline

Without `await`:

```
[push CreateNote] → [refreshNotes runs] → [user still writing note] → [pop CreateNote]
```

With `await`:

```
[push CreateNote] → [user writes note] → [pop CreateNote] → [refreshNotes runs]
```

---

⚡ So: **the `Future` returned by `Navigator.push` only completes when the route is popped**. That’s what ensures the order.
